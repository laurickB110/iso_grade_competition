  "key_patterns": [
    "Pattern 1: The 'optimized_solution' solver consistently outperforms 'solve' by 12.9-15.5%, suggesting it employs more sophisticated heuristics or local search refinements that are universally beneficial across dataset types",
    "Pattern 2: Performance gap increases with dataset size - 4.6M improvement for 2601 buildings vs 6.6M for 5000 buildings, indicating optimization techniques scale better than baseline approaches",
    "Pattern 3: Both solvers show similar relative performance regardless of spatial distribution (moderate vs dense) or clustering levels, suggesting current approaches may not be fully exploiting spatial structure",
    "Pattern 4: The absolute cost per building is lower for larger datasets (14.3k for 5000 buildings vs 12.0k for 2601), indicating economies of scale that both solvers capture similarly"
  ],
  "solver_strengths": {
    "optimized_solution": "Achieves 13-15% cost reduction consistently across different dataset characteristics. Likely implements iterative refinement, better facility placement heuristics, or more sophisticated assignment strategies. Scales effectively with dataset size, showing 43% better improvement on larger instances. Appears to handle both moderate and dense spatial distributions equally well.",
    "solve": "Provides consistent baseline performance and likely faster runtime. Serves as a reasonable initial solution generator. The consistent performance gap suggests it uses a stable, predictable algorithm (possibly greedy construction or simple clustering) that guarantees feasible solutions."
  },
  "solver_weaknesses": {
    "optimized_solution": "Still leaves significant optimization potential on the table (31-36M absolute costs suggest room for 20-30% further improvement based on typical facility location benchmarks). Doesn't show differential performance based on spatial distribution or clustering, missing opportunities to exploit problem structure. The uniform improvement rate suggests it may use generic optimization that doesn't adapt to dataset characteristics.",
    "solve": "Underperforms by 13-15% consistently, indicating lack of refinement phase. Likely uses first-fit or greedy approaches without backtracking. The performance gap widens with scale, suggesting algorithmic complexity that doesn't leverage parallel structure or spatial decomposition. May not consider global optimization - possibly myopic in facility placement decisions."
  },
  "dataset_insights": {
    "3_suburbia": "Moderate spatial distribution with low clustering (2601 buildings) represents a scattered demand pattern. Cost of 12.0k per building suggests challenging connectivity requirements. The 'moderate' distribution may create ambiguous facility placement zones where both solvers struggle to find clear optimal locations. Low clustering means fewer opportunities for demand aggregation, forcing more distributed antenna placement.",
    "4_epitech": "Despite being dense with 5000 buildings, low clustering indicates uniform distribution rather than natural demand centers. This is counterintuitive - density without clustering suggests artificial or grid-like layouts that may violate typical spatial assumptions. Cost per building (7.2k for optimized) is actually better than suburbia despite larger scale, suggesting density enables better coverage overlap. Both solvers may be missing opportunities to exploit the dense-but-uniform structure through spatial partitioning strategies."
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement adaptive spatial decomposition: Use quadtree or k-d tree partitioning to exploit local structure differently for dense-uniform vs moderate-scattered distributions. Could yield 10-15% improvement on dense instances.",
    "Add clustering-aware preprocessing: Even with 'low' clustering, identify micro-clusters using DBSCAN or hierarchical methods. Place facilities at weighted centroids of these clusters rather than using generic heuristics.",
    "Develop multi-phase optimization: (1) Fast greedy construction (like 'solve'), (2) Local search with 2-opt facility swaps, (3) Demand reassignment phase with flow optimization. Each phase should take 5-10 iterations maximum.",
    "Exploit scale differences: For N>3000, use hierarchical facility placement (place hub facilities, then satellite facilities). For N<3000, use direct optimization with Voronoi-based assignment.",
    "Implement cost-gradient guided search: Calculate marginal cost changes for facility relocations and prioritize moves with steepest descent. This could help break the 13-15% improvement plateau.",
    "Add diversity-driven restarts: Current solvers show consistent but plateaued performance - implement 3-5 randomized initial configurations with different spatial seeds, then select best. Cost: 3-5x runtime, benefit: potential 15-25% improvement.",
    "Leverage density metrics: Create a density heatmap (100x100 grid) and place facilities at local maxima weighted by total demand in radius. This is missing from both solvers given their uniform behavior across dense vs moderate distributions.",
    "Implement constraint-aware facility placement: Pre-compute feasible facility zones based on demand coverage radius and capacity constraints, then solve reduced integer programming problem only over these zones.",
    "Add late-acceptance hill climbing: Accept solutions within 5% of current best even if worse, to escape local optima. Iterate for 1000*sqrt(N) steps. Could bridge the remaining gap to theoretical optimum."
