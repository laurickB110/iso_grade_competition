  "key_patterns": [
    "Pattern 1: The 'optimized_solution' solver consistently outperforms 'solve' by 12.9-15.5%, suggesting it incorporates more sophisticated optimization techniques (local search, metaheuristics, or better initialization)",
    "Pattern 2: Performance gap increases with problem size - 4.6M difference on 2601 buildings vs 6.6M on 5000 buildings (43% larger gap), indicating 'solve' scales less efficiently",
    "Pattern 3: Both solvers show similar relative performance regardless of clustering level (low in both cases), suggesting spatial clustering may not be the primary performance differentiator - building count and density appear more critical",
    "Pattern 4: Dense spatial distributions (4_epitech) don't proportionally increase costs despite 92% more buildings, hinting that proximity enables better antenna sharing opportunities"
  ],
  "solver_strengths": {
    "optimized_solution": "Achieves 13-15% better costs consistently across different scales and distributions. Likely employs iterative refinement or advanced heuristics that exploit local structure. Appears to better leverage density - only 15% cost increase for 92% more buildings in dense scenario. Strong scalability characteristics.",
    "solve": "Provides baseline solutions that are reasonable but suboptimal. Likely faster execution time (given simpler approach). May use greedy or constructive heuristics that work adequately for initial feasible solutions. Consistent enough to serve as a reliable starting point."
  },
  "solver_weaknesses": {
    "optimized_solution": "While best performer, absolute costs remain high (31-36M range), suggesting room for improvement. May still be trapped in local optima. Possibly missing global optimization opportunities or advanced problem decomposition strategies.",
    "solve": "Scales poorly - 43% larger performance gap on bigger instances. Likely lacks refinement phase or uses overly simplistic placement strategy. May be placing antennas independently without considering shared coverage potential. Appears to miss optimization opportunities that become more valuable at scale."
  },
  "dataset_insights": {
    "3_suburbia": "Moderate spatial distribution with 2601 buildings creates fragmentation challenges - antennas may need wider coverage areas or more redundant placement. Low clustering means fewer opportunities for efficient multi-building coverage from single antennas. Cost per building (~12,032) is higher than 4_epitech, suggesting dispersion penalty.",
    "4_epitech": "Dense distribution should theoretically enable better antenna sharing, and indeed shows lower cost per building (~7,219). However, 5000 buildings with low clustering is counterintuitive - may have dense pockets with sparse inter-pocket gaps. This heterogeneity could challenge solvers that assume uniform density. The 'dense but low clustering' characteristic suggests multiple separated dense zones."
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement multi-phase optimization: Use 'solve' for fast initial solution, then apply 'optimized_solution' techniques for refinement. The consistent 13-15% gap suggests this hybrid could combine speed and quality.",
    "Develop density-aware placement algorithms: Given 92% more buildings only add 15% cost in dense scenarios, create heuristics that specifically identify and exploit high-density regions for shared antenna placement.",
    "Add spatial clustering preprocessing: Low clustering correlates with worse per-building costs. Implement clustering detection (DBSCAN/k-means) to identify natural groups and optimize within clusters first, then handle inter-cluster connections.",
    "Scale-adaptive strategy selection: Since performance gaps grow with problem size, implement dynamic algorithm selection - use greedy methods for <3000 buildings, switch to metaheuristics (simulated annealing, tabu search) for larger instances.",
    "Antenna range optimization: Investigate if variable antenna ranges/powers could reduce costs. Suburban sprawl may benefit from long-range antennas while dense areas need short-range precise placement.",
    "Coverage overlap minimization: The significant gap between solvers suggests 'solve' may create redundant coverage. Implement explicit overlap penalty or coverage deduplication phase.",
    "Exploit demand patterns: Average demand varies (1233 vs 1006) - incorporate demand-weighted placement where high-demand buildings get prioritized for optimal antenna assignment.",
    "Local search enhancement: Add 2-opt or 3-opt style neighborhood search for antenna repositioning, particularly for the 'solve' baseline. This could capture some of 'optimized_solution' gains cheaply.",
    "Investigate cost structure: Understand if costs are dominated by antenna count, coverage radius, or transmission power. This will guide whether to focus on minimizing antenna count vs. optimizing individual antenna parameters."
