  "key_patterns": [
    "Pattern 1: The 'optimized_solution' solver consistently outperforms 'solve' by 12.9-15.5%, suggesting it incorporates additional optimization heuristics or local search refinements that the basic solver lacks",
    "Pattern 2: Performance gap increases with dataset size (4.6M difference for 2601 buildings vs 6.6M for 5000 buildings), indicating that optimization techniques scale better and provide compounding benefits on larger instances",
    "Pattern 3: Both solvers handle low-clustering datasets, but the relative improvement is consistent (~13-15%), suggesting the optimization techniques are robust across different spatial distributions",
    "Pattern 4: Dense spatial distributions (4_epitech) with more buildings don't proportionally increase costs, implying efficient solvers can leverage proximity for antenna sharing"
  ],
  "solver_strengths": {
    "optimized_solution": "Excels at cost reduction through likely mechanisms: (1) better antenna placement optimization considering demand patterns, (2) improved building-to-antenna assignment using local search or reassignment heuristics, (3) possible post-processing refinement. The consistent 13-15% improvement suggests systematic optimization rather than random variation. Scales well with problem size, extracting more value from larger search spaces.",
    "solve": "Provides reasonable baseline solutions quickly, likely using constructive heuristics (greedy placement, nearest-neighbor assignment). Predictable performance makes it reliable for initial solutions or time-constrained scenarios. Handles both moderate and dense spatial distributions adequately."
  },
  "solver_weaknesses": {
    "optimized_solution": "While superior, the 12.9-15.5% gap suggests room for improvement. May still be using localized optimization that misses global structural patterns. The increasing absolute gap with size (4.6M\u21926.6M) hints at potential scalability challenges in optimization thoroughness.",
    "solve": "Lacks refinement mechanisms, leaving 13-15% optimization potential untapped. The growing performance gap with dataset size (2601\u21925000 buildings) indicates poor scaling of solution quality. Likely uses simple greedy heuristics without reassignment or look-ahead, resulting in suboptimal antenna placements and building assignments."
  },
  "dataset_insights": {
    "3_suburbia": "Moderate spatial distribution with low clustering (2601 buildings) creates scattered placement challenges. Average demand of 1233.0 is relatively high, requiring careful antenna capacity planning. The 'moderate' distribution likely forces tradeoffs between coverage area and antenna utilization, making optimal placement non-trivial.",
    "4_epitech": "Dense spatial distribution with 5000 buildings offers both opportunities (antenna sharing, coverage overlap) and challenges (capacity constraints, assignment complexity). Lower average demand (1006.316) with density suggests potential for efficient shared antenna infrastructure, but the combinatorial complexity increases exponentially. Low clustering despite density indicates relatively uniform spread rather than tight groups, preventing simple cluster-based solutions."
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement multi-phase optimization: (1) Initial clustering/partitioning to identify natural service zones, (2) Optimal antenna placement within zones using k-center or facility location algorithms, (3) Cross-zone optimization to handle boundary cases",
    "Add demand-aware placement: Weight antenna locations by cumulative demand in coverage area rather than just building count. High-demand buildings should influence placement more strongly",
    "Implement iterative reassignment: After initial placement, run multiple passes of building reassignment considering both distance and antenna capacity utilization. Use 2-opt or 3-opt style swaps to escape local optima",
    "Develop spatial indexing: Use quadtrees or R-trees for efficient neighbor queries, enabling faster evaluation of alternative placements without exhaustive distance calculations",
    "Add capacity-balancing objective: Minimize variance in antenna load utilization to avoid overprovisioning. This should reduce total antenna count while maintaining service quality",
    "Implement adaptive granularity: Use coarse-grained optimization for initial placement on large datasets, then refine with fine-grained local search in promising regions",
    "Explore problem decomposition: For datasets >3000 buildings, partition into overlapping subproblems, solve independently, then merge with boundary optimization",
    "Add look-ahead heuristics: When placing antennas greedily, evaluate impact on future placement opportunities, not just immediate cost reduction",
    "Implement solution perturbation: Generate multiple diverse initial solutions using randomized algorithms, then apply local optimization to each and select the best",
    "Consider metaheuristics for large instances: Simulated annealing or genetic algorithms could explore solution space more thoroughly for datasets with 5000+ buildings where exact methods become intractable"
