  "key_patterns": [
    "Pattern 1: The 'optimized_solution' solver consistently outperforms 'solve' by 12.9-15.5%, suggesting it employs superior heuristics or local search refinements that are effective across different problem scales",
    "Pattern 2: Performance gap increases with problem size - 4.625M improvement (12.9%) on 2601 buildings vs 6.605M improvement (15.5%) on 5000 buildings, indicating 'optimized_solution' scales better to larger instances",
    "Pattern 3: Both solvers maintain effectiveness across different spatial distributions (moderate vs dense) and clustering patterns (both low), suggesting the algorithms are robust to geometric variations but may not fully exploit clustering opportunities",
    "Pattern 4: Cost per building decreases with scale (12,036/building for 2601 buildings vs 7,219/building for 5000 buildings), indicating economies of scale that solvers should explicitly model"
  ],
  "solver_strengths": {
    "optimized_solution": "Demonstrates strong scaling properties with 13-15% better performance across all tested scenarios. Likely employs multi-phase optimization (construction + improvement) or advanced neighborhood search that becomes more effective as solution space grows. Handles both moderate and dense spatial distributions effectively.",
    "solve": "Provides reasonable baseline solutions quickly, suggesting it may be a simpler greedy or constructive heuristic. Its consistency (never catastrophically bad) indicates robust fundamental logic that could serve as a strong initialization phase."
  },
  "solver_weaknesses": {
    "optimized_solution": "Still shows absolute cost increases with problem size, suggesting potential gaps in: (1) exploiting low clustering patterns for shared infrastructure, (2) optimal antenna placement strategies for dense distributions, (3) may be computationally expensive given better results",
    "solve": "Leaves 12.9-15.5% performance on the table compared to optimized approach. Likely uses: (1) insufficient local search or refinement, (2) greedy decisions without look-ahead, (3) suboptimal antenna placement or building assignment strategies. Gap widens with scale, indicating poor large-instance strategies."
  },
  "dataset_insights": {
    "3_suburbia": "Moderate spatial distribution with 2601 buildings presents mid-scale optimization challenge. Low clustering (despite moderate distribution) suggests buildings are spread without natural groupings - this prevents simple cluster-based decomposition. High average demand (1233.0) means antenna capacity constraints are likely binding, requiring careful load balancing.",
    "4_epitech": "Dense spatial distribution with 5000 buildings but low clustering is counterintuitive - suggests uniform dense coverage rather than distinct hotspots. This makes it challenging because: (1) many feasible antenna locations, (2) overlapping coverage zones complicate assignment, (3) lower avg demand (1006.316) means capacity less constraining but distance optimization becomes critical. The larger gap between solvers here suggests room for sophisticated spatial optimization."
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement hierarchical clustering preprocessing: Even with 'low clustering', spatial decomposition could reduce problem complexity. Use k-means or density-based clustering to create subproblems, solve locally, then optimize boundaries.",
    "Develop demand-aware antenna placement: High-demand areas (suburbia with 1233 avg) need different strategies than lower-demand dense areas. Use weighted centroid calculations or facility location algorithms that account for demand variance.",
    "Add adaptive neighborhood search: The widening gap with scale suggests local search scope matters. Implement variable neighborhood descent (VND) with neighborhoods sized proportional to problem scale: edge swaps, antenna relocations, building reassignments.",
    "Exploit density patterns: For dense distributions like epitech, use Voronoi-based initial placements to ensure coverage efficiency, then refine. For moderate distributions, consider hub-and-spoke topologies.",
    "Incorporate capacity-aware construction: The 'solve' baseline could improve by checking antenna utilization during construction and splitting overloaded antennas proactively rather than reactively.",
    "Design hybrid solver: Start with fast 'solve'-like construction for initial feasible solution, then apply 'optimized_solution' refinement techniques. Add time-based stopping criteria to balance quality vs computation.",
    "Add problem-specific operators: Design moves that swap multiple buildings between antennas simultaneously, relocate antennas to demand centroids, or merge underutilized antennas - these could bridge the 13-15% gap.",
    "Implement learning-based initialization: Use dataset characteristics (buildings, spatial distribution, avg demand, clustering) to predict good initial antenna counts and positions via regression or nearest-neighbor lookup from solved instances."
